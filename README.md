## Project Structure

This project is a monorepo powered by [Pnpm Workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/).

## How to run

1. In the root directory, run `pnpm build`. This will build both `mock-api` and `ui`.
2. Then run `pnpm start`. This will run both `mock-api` and `ui` at parallel.
